        <h1 class="clap">Notifications</h1>
        <p>The March #CodePenChallenge starts now!</p><br>
        <p>This month, we're going to take a deep dive into the design<br>
            and function of notifications üîî</p><br>
        <p>Love them or hate them, notifications are an important<br>
           feature of so many sites & apps. Well thought out,<br>
           pleasingly designed notifications can make the difference<br>
           between a UX that bugs the user and a fun interaction that<br>
           the user looks forward to seeing!</p><br>
        <p>Each week this March we'll work with a different piece of<br>
           the notification experience. We'll have plenty of ideas and<br>
           resources as we go to keep you notified of how to approach<br>
           the challenge. And, the skills you grow in each challenge<br>
           will help you tackle the next one.</p>

      <p>2024 is a leap year, a calendar phenomenon that adds an<br>
         extra day to February every four years (with some <br>
         exceptions, which we'll get into later).</p><br>
      <p>In honor of this special year, we'll spend all 29 days of <br>
         February leaping around the front-end, playing with the <br>
         "leap" theme and building JavaScript and CSS skills as we <br>
         go.</p><br>
      <p>Every Monday for the next 4 weeks we'll give you a starter <br>
         template, plus lots of ideas and resources to help you leap <br>

     <h1 class="clap">Navigation</h1>
     <p>The September #CodePenChallenge starts now!</p><br>
     <p>This month, we're focusing on navigation ‚õµÔ∏è</p><br>
     <p>Good navigation helps your visitors find the shortest, <br>
        clearest path to the thing they want to do in your site or <br>
        app. There's a bit of an art to it, and it helps to have a lot of <br>
        design patterns in your tool chest. This month is all about <br>
        building up those tools!</p><br>
    <p>All through September, we'll give you a navigation style or <br>
        technique as a prompt, plus a starter template and a ton of <br>
        ideas & resources to help you navigate through the <br>
        challenge.</p>

     <h1 class="clap">Photos</h1>
     <p>Welcome to the August #CodePenChallenge!</p><br>
     <p>This month is all about photos üì∏</p><br>
     <p>Photos are a major part of what makes the web fun, <br>
        informative, and useful, so of course front-end developers <br>
        spend a whole lot of time working with them. This month's <br>
        challenge is filled with fun opportunities to hone or flex <br>
        your HTML, CSS, and JavaScript skills as we build Pens <br>
        with photos.</p><br>
     <p>All through August, we'll dig into the details of photos on <br>
        the web, from the HTML basics all the way through to <br>
        interactive photo experiences.</p><br>
     <p>Each week's prompt will add on to what we learned in the <br>
        previous week, and on week four we'll have a fun final <br>
        project that brings it all together. Throughout the <br>
        challenge, we'll have lots of ideas to spark your imagination <br>
        and plenty of resources to help you level up your skills.</p>

    <p>This month, we're going to be playing with particles üéÜ</p>
    <p>So, what's a particle?</p><br>
    <p>Often, they look like <span class="utg">dots</span> or <span class="utg">confetti</span>. Sometimes they're <br>
        <span class="utg">super-tiny</span>. In front end development, "particles" <br>
        encompass everything from <span class="utg">floating bokeh dots</span> in the <br>
        background of a page to interactive <span class="utg">"particle systems"</span> with <br>
        realistic physical properties.</p><br>
    <p>This month you'll have a chance to try all kinds of different <br>
        particle permutations, and we'll hook you up with lots of <br>
        ideas and resources to help you build new front-end skills <br>
        or flex your particle panache.</p>

      <p>CodePen Challenges are purely for fun. It's not a competition. There is nothing to <br>
       lose, and the only thing to gain is skill through practice. It's in the style of the ol' <br>
       <span class="utg">CodePen Pattern Rodeo's </span>and community-organized events like<span class="utg"> #Codevember</span>.<br>
